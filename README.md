<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[//]: # ([![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]&#40;https://example.com&#41;)

We live in a weird timeline, where articles from satirical websites are sometimes mistaken
for true articles. [The Onion](https://www.theonion.com/) is an example of such a website
that spawned two subreddits: [/r/TheOnion](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheOnion/), and [/r/NotTheOnion](https://old.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/).
The latter contains news so bizarre that they could belong to The Onion.

This website shows you two headlines, one taken from [/r/TheOnion](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheOnion/) and another from [/r/NotTheOnion](https://old.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/).
Your goal is to guess which one is from [/r/TheOnion](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheOnion/)! There are trackers for how many
times you guessed right, and how many times you guessed right _in a row_. If you find a certain combination to be particularly funny or challenging, you
can easily share it with your friends or followers.

Hope you enjoy!
